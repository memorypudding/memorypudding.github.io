Hi there, my name is Hollow. I'm 20 years old. I've been around the hacking scene for a couple years now. 

Hacking is just a hobby mainly, i've never been able to land in a job in the area mainly due to my poor social skills.
Anyways. I started learning Python when I was around 13 years old so its been about 7 years since ive started dabbling with computers.
Most of my research and hacking has been on and off due to me struggling with mental health issues. 

I can go on and on about my life story but I don't want to bore the reader. Most of my interests lie in web app security, osint, and programming.
I've done a lot of research on OSINT mainly practicing on celebrities and random users on the internet (I DO NOT condone doxxing).
The reason i'm starting a blog is mainly so I can start making a name for myself and encourage myself to learn more.

That being said, I hope this blog marks a new beginning in my journey for learning. Hack The Planet.

## Achievments
Here's a list of some of my favorite personal achievments over the years.
* My first RCE ever was on an isps login portal using a .NET deserialzation vulnerability. I got my first ever badge on hackerone.
* Another favorite RCE of mine is using a similar .NET deserialzation vuln. on a site that sold concert tickets. I reported that vulnerability but they never patched until they got hacked by some other random xD.
* One of my friends favorites tools of mine was a people lookup tool I made using a site similar to spokeo. I found a vulnerability to bypass the payment system via api and made a very cool people lookup tool that returned court records and even ssns.
